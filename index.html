          <div class="article"><p>San Diego has a little bit of everything for the whole family.
            A place where children and adults can have a memorable experience.
            With multiple restaurants, hotels, beaches, and attractions, San Diego is a unique place.
            San Diego is considered to have a mild Mediterranean climate that is wonderful when you want to be out and about.
            Most attractions are located outside but you are never too far from water.
            Whether it's attractions like SeaWorld or the many beaches that San Diego has to offer, there is always a way to keep cool.
